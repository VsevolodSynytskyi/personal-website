## Design and Development

I work at the intersection of design and development.

I'm a product designer, specializing in creating intuitive, user-friendly
interfaces and bringing them to life with my frontend development skills.

My main tech stack: React JS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion...

## Recent Experience

For over 2 years, I've been improving the user experience of a SaaS product used to manage construction projects in the US.

I always feel the need to create: Iâ€™ve run a coworking space, started a volunteer service, and worked on a few pet projects.
